"Previously, the object in ``scope[\"user\"]`` was one of Django's "
"SimpleLazyObjects, which then called our ``get_user`` async function via "
"``async_to_sync``."

"This worked fine when called from SyncConsumers, but because async "
"environments do not run attribute access in an async fashion, when the "
"body of an async consumer tried to call it, the ``asgiref`` library "
"flagged an error where the code was trying to call a synchronous function"
" during a async context."

"To fix this, the User object is now loaded non-lazily on application "
"startup. This introduces a blocking call during the synchronous "
"application constructor, so the ASGI spec has been updated to recommend "
"that constructors for ASGI apps are called in a threadpool and Daphne "
"2.1.1 implements this and is recommended for use with this release."
