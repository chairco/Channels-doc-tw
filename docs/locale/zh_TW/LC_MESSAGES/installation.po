"Please be wary of any other third-party apps that require an overloaded or "
"replacement ``runserver`` command. Channels provides a separate "
"``runserver`` command and may conflict with it. An example of such a "
"conflict is with `whitenoise.runserver_nostatic "
"<https://github.com/evansd/whitenoise/issues/77>`_ from `whitenoise "
"<https://github.com/evansd/whitenoise>`_. In order to solve such issues, try"
" moving ``channels`` to the top of your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` or remove the "
